MDS: New Allocator Account
Dear %contactName%,

We welcome you to our Metadata Store on %mdsUrl%.

An account was created for you. Your login name (symbol) is:

  %symbol%
  
To activate your account and set the initial password you have to go to 

  %mdsUrl%/resources/change_password?symbol=%symbol%&auth=%magicAuth%
  
This link is valid for at least 24 hours.

After successful login you are able to create datacentres under your
symbol prefix (e.g. %symbol%.DC). By default a welcome mail is sent to 
each newly created datacentre, so they can set there password on their own. 

Via the "User Info" link on the upper right corner you can e.g. see the
list of your DOI prefixes. 

Kind regards,
